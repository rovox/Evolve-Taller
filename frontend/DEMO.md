# Evolve RWA Demo Frontend

Visual demonstration interface for Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization on the Evolve sovereign rollup.

## 🎯 Features

- **System Status Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of deployed contracts and RPC connectivity
- **Contract Interactions**: Register documents, mint tokens, and interact with the RWA vault
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect with MetaMask to the local rollup (chain ID: 1234)
- **Live Block Updates**: Shows current block number and contract deployment status
- **Visual Feedback**: Toast notifications and loading states for all transactions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Automatic Start (via Tilt)

The frontend automatically starts when you run the full stack:

```bash
# From repo root
tilt up
```

The frontend will be available at: **http://localhost:5173**

### Manual Start

If you want to run the frontend independently:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Note**: Make sure contracts are deployed first and addresses are synced:

```bash
# From repo root
./sync-contract-addresses.sh
```

## 📦 What It Shows

### System Status Panel
- ✅ RPC connection status and current block number
- ✅ DocumentRegistry deployment and address
- ✅ AssetToken (ERC721) deployment and address
- ✅ RWASovereignRollup deployment and address
- 🔗 Direct links to Blockscout explorer for each contract

### Interactive Features
- **Connect Wallet**: Connect MetaMask to the rollup (localhost:8545, chain ID: 1234)
- **Register Documents**: Submit document hashes to the DocumentRegistry
- **Mint Tokens**: Create RWA tokens (requires ownership)
- **Deposit Assets**: Interact with the RWA vault

## 🎨 Demo Tips

### For Live Presentations

1. **Start with System Status**: Show all green checkmarks indicating successful deployment
2. **Connect Wallet**: Demonstrate MetaMask connection to the custom rollup
3. **Register a Document**: Use the interface to register a real document hash
4. **Show Explorer**: Click "View" buttons to show contracts in Blockscout
5. **Live Updates**: Point out the block number incrementing in real-time

### Customization

Edit contract addresses in `.env.local` (auto-generated by sync script):

```bash
VITE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_RWA_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
VITE_CHAIN_ID=1234
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Contracts not deployed" warning
- Ensure `tilt up` has finished deploying contracts
- Check that `deployed-addresses.env` exists in `rwa-soberano-evolve/`
- Run `./sync-contract-addresses.sh` from repo root

### MetaMask connection issues
- Add the custom network manually:
  - Network Name: Evolve Rollup (Local)
  - RPC URL: http://localhost:8545
  - Chain ID: 1234
  - Currency: ETH

### RPC not connecting
- Verify Reth is running: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'`
- Check Tilt dashboard at http://localhost:10350 for service status
